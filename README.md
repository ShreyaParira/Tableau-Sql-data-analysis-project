## 🧩 Dataset

- **Source**: Prosper Marketplace
- **File**: `prosper loan dataset.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains details on ~113K loans issued between 2005 and 2014, including borrower profiles, loan terms, repayment performance, credit scores, and Prosper ratings.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Load the Dataset into MySQL**:
   - Use the `Data Definition Language.sql` to create the `prosperloandata_temp` table.
   - Load the dataset with:
     ```sql
     LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'path_to/prosper loan dataset.csv' INTO TABLE prosperloandata_temp
     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' 
     LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;
     ```

2. **Run SQL Queries**:
   - Use `Analysis.sql`, `Loan_Portfolio_Analysis.sql`, and `Metrics.sql` to explore various insights.
   - Ensure you update any database/table names as needed.

3. **Explore Tableau Dashboard**:
   - Open `Loan Performance Metrics.twbx` in Tableau Desktop.
   - Explore dynamic charts and summaries for disbursement, losses, recovery rates, and more.
